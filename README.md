## Expected Project Output
1. A tidy data set.
2. A link to a Github repository with the scripts that were created and used.
3. A code book.md in the GitHub repository with my scripts.
4. The Analysis R Script
5. The README file with descriptive content (this file).

# Project Aim
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements that exist on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement taht aloows it.
3. Use descriptive activity names for the activities in the data set
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names for ease of visualization.
5. Create a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject as the final output

#Libraries Used
The libraries used in this module were data.table and dplyr.
1. library(data.table)
2. library(dplyr)
